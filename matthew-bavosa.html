          IN <a href="http://danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/">"CONTENT Display Patterns" </a> (which all front-end folk should read), Dan
          Mall points to a truth not unlike the one <a href="https://24ways.org/2015/putting-my-patterns-through-their-paces/"> Ethan Marcotte shared last month </a>
          on 24 ways. It is a truth as old as standards-based design: Construct your
          markup to properly support your content (not your design).

          Modular/atomic design doesn’t change this truth, it just reinforces its
          wisdom. Flexbox and grid layout don’t change this truth, they just make it
          easier to do it better. HTML5 doesn’t change this truth, it just reminds us
          that the separation of structure from style came into existence for a reason.
          A reason that hasn’t changed. A reason that cannot change, because it is the
          core truth of the web, and is inextricably bound up with the promise of this medium
